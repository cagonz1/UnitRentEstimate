# Unit Rent Estimate Calculations

This is a collection of code to act as a foundation for a replacement system 
of the current rent calculation worksheets.

1. create a branch 
2. 'check out' the branch and begin working on any changes you want.  The new branch lets you make
   any changes without causing permanent issues.
3. when you are finished you will need to commit the changes to the main branch
   by selecting the commit button, or check mark at the 'top right' corner of the screen.
4. once the changes are committed you will be able to then merge the new branch into the main file.
5. after the merge, you can select the push button that looks like a green up arrow.
6. now the changes are sent to the hub. you will be able to update the system once you
   get home.

Note - the ure calculates everything that elite does except the Maximum Rent to Owner & Maximum Family 
Contribution.  The HAS uses the URE to generate the notes for elite.  It is then printed and saved.  
A copy is given to the tennant and the file is saved in the client file.  When the tenant finds a place
they return and the HAS is supposed to reference elite and review the notes to make sure they arent 
trying to get a house with rent that is above their Max Rent To Owner.  

Max Rent To Owner is calculated using seperate foundation metrix that elite does not provide.
---in other words elite dosent calculate this---
